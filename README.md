#About this application#

This simple to-do application will record all of the tasks you enter and save them to your profile when logged in. You can check off each task as you complete them and filter through all of the tasks to view ones that have been completed, still in progress, and those which are high-priority.

#How to use#

It is best you log into the application using your Google account, or registering a new account manually (You can create a fake one for testing only).

#Task options#
Creating a task : To create a new task, click on the 'NEW TASK' button and enter a task name (required), a task priority level (required), and additional notes (optional) within the popup modal.

Modifying a task: To modify an existing task, click on the edit button (middle button with three lines) beside the individual task on the main screen. All of the existing data will be pre-filled, you will simply make edits within the modal and click submit when done. Edits will permanently overwrite existing data for the item in Firebase.

Deleting a task: To delete a task where simply checking off the task as complete is not applicable, click on the 'X' button. Deleting is permanent and will erase the data from Firebase.

Completing a task: To mark a task as complete, click on the button with the tick. Completed tasks will show only on the 'ALL', or 'COMPLETED' filter pages.

#Other#

The left hand side of the main page will tell you how many tasks are being tracked, how many tasks are completed, and how many are prioritised. To view each, click on the filter headings on the top section of the 'tasks' page.

If you choose to log into the application, all your tasks will be automatically saved and you can log out and back in as you wish to view, update, or create tasks.
